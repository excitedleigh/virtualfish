# virtualfish
A Fish Shell wrapper for Ian Bicking's virtualenv, somewhat loosely based on Doug Hellman's virtualenvwrapper for Bash.

## Installation
1. Source `virtual.fish` somewhere in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, like this:

		. path/to/virtual.fish

2. [Customize your `fish_prompt`](#customizing-your-fish_prompt)

## Usage

### Commands
* `acvirtualenv <envname>` (or `workon <envname>`*) - Activate a virtualenv. (Note: Doesn't use the `activate.fish` script provided by virtualenv.)
* `devirtualenv` (or `deactivate`*) - Deactivate the current virtualenv.
* `mkvirtualenv [<options>] <envname>` - Create a virtualenv. Note that `<envname>` *must be last*.
* `rmvirtualenv <envname>` - Delete a virtualenv.
* `lsvirtualenv` - List the available virtualenvs.
* `cdvirtualenv` - Change directory to currently-activated virtualenv.

\*with `VIRTUALFISH_COMPAT_ALIASES` switched on - see Configuration Variables below.

### Variables
* `VIRTUAL_ENV` - Path to the currently active virtualenv.
	* Tips: use `basename` to get the virtualenv's name, or `set -q` to see whether a virtualenv is active at all.

### Events

virtualfish emits Fish events instead of using hook scripts. To hook in to events that virtualfish emits, write a function like this:

	function myfunc --on-event virtualenv_did_activate
		echo "The virtualenv" (basename $VIRTUAL_ENV) "was activated"
	end

You can save your function using `funcsave`, put it in `.config/fish/config.fish`, or put it anywhere Fish will see it before it needs to run.

Some events are emitted twice, once normally and once with the name of the virtualenv as part of the event name. This is to make it easier to listen for events relevant to one specific virtualenv, for example:

	function myfunc --on-event virtualenv_did_activate:my_site_env
		set -gx DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE mysite.settings
	end

The full list of events is:

* `virtualenv_will_activate`
* `virtualenv_will_activate:<env name>`
* `virtualenv_did_activate`
* `virtualenv_did_activate:<env name>`
* `virtualenv_will_deactivate`
* `virtualenv_will_deactivate:<env name>`
* `virtualenv_did_deactivate`
* `virtualenv_did_deactivate:<env name>`

### Configuration Variables
All of these must be set before `virtual.fish` is sourced in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.

* `VIRTUALFISH_HOME` (default: `~/.virtualenvs`) - where all your virtualenvs are kept.
* `VIRTUALFISH_COMPAT_ALIASES` - set this to create aliases for `workon` and `deactivate` a la virtualenvwrapper. *Caveat: `deactivate` exists (and can be overwritten) even when a virtualenv is not active.*

### Customizing Your `fish_prompt`
virtualfish doesn't attempt to mess with your prompt. Since Fish's prompt is a function, it is both much less straightforward to change it automatically, and much more convenient to simply customize it manually to your liking.

The easiest way to add virtualenv to your prompt is to type `funced fish_prompt`, add the following line in somewhere:

	if set -q VIRTUAL_ENV
		echo -n -s (set_color -b blue white) "(" (basename "$VIRTUAL_ENV") ")" (set_color normal) " "
	end

Then, type `funcsave fish_prompt` to save your new prompt to disk.

## To Do

* Emit more Fish events where virtualenvwrapper would use hook scripts
* mktempenv, showvirtualenv, cpvirtualenv
* long form of lsvirtualenv
* Project management
